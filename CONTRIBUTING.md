# Contributing to BMMRO

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! We are grateful for each volunteer developer helping this project come to fruition.
We welcome your input in:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## How to contribute

We organise our work in a [kanban board](https://github.com/BMMRO-tech/BMMRO/projects/1). Each issue is catagorised with one or more of the following tags:

- Story: A unit of work, usually functionality within the app
- Spike: An investigation, timebox max 2 days
- Tech task: A technical task that is neither a story nor spike
- Task: Any non-development task
- Bug: Something isn't working
- Blocked: Can't continue to work on a particular thing
- Good first story: Good for newcomers

The tasks are organised in order of priority with the first task in the column being highest priority. If you want to start work on a card, please reach out to a [maintainer](README.md#repository-maintenance)
