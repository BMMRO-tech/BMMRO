## Template

Hello BMMRO team,

We've just released a new version of the BMMRO web app that contains significant changes.
Here are the steps needed in order to get the new version:

- If you are using Chrome or Safari browsers on a desktop, or Chrome browser on an Android device: reload/refresh the page, close the tab and open it again.

- If you have installed the BMMRO app on an Android device: reload the app by doing the pull-to-refresh gesture, kill the app and open it again.

- If you are using Chrome or Safari browsers on an iOS/iPadOS device: reload the page (in the options menu or hit the URL directly).

- If you have installed the BMMRO app on an iOS/iPadOS device: open and kill the app twice.

After performing the steps above, please check that the version number in the footer is XYZ.

Thanks!
