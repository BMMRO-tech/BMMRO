# Bahamas Marine Mammal Research Organization (BMMRO)
## Overview
Bahamas Marine Mammal Research Organization (BMMRO) is not just a mouthfull but is also a non-profit scientific research organisation run by world renowned scientists finding marine mammals in and around Abaco Island, Bahamas, understanding their primary areas of habitation and using what they learn to make a difference. This page is here because we believe technology can help them better than it currently is. Join us...

## Goals
- Develop BMMRO‚Äôs technical infrastructure:
- Build software to enable and improve scientistific research at BMMRO
- Be a technical consultant to BMMRO

## Milestones
- ‚úÖ**Inception**
- ‚úÖ**As-is inforgraphic**
Gather information about the current ‚Äúas-is‚Äù technology and processes being used
- üö¶**HUDS** (Habitat Use Data Sheet)
Build an application to improve the data gathered about habitats whilst researchers are on boat surveys. By the end of this milestone, they should be using a browser based UI (PWA?) to gather data for habitats from typical consumer devices (smart phones, pads, laptops), it should be stored securely on the cloud and accessible to export for use in their current R based analytics workflow
- üö¶**ESDS** (Encounter Sighting Data Sheet)
This will extend the application to enable capturing encounter data when marine wildlife is sighted on boat trips
- üö¶**Data Migration Tool**
This will provide a tool to migrate data from their current MS Access database to the new data store. It should be idempotent to allow for multiple migrations without data corruption or duplication and thus allowing old and new world to co-exist
- üö¶**Media Link**
Research, incept and build on the existing system to allow their extensive collection of media (images, video, audio) data to be linked in a meaningful way to the HUDS and ESDS data. Look for opportunities to improve the gathering of this data along the way
- üö¶**TBC**
Potential future work could be further app improvements, more accessible or sophisticated data analysis, website improvements, integrating data into their website.
