# Upload Script

This is a script to bulk upload data into firestore database that was used to upload the project list for the dropdown. The document id will be automatically generated by firestore.

### Upload process
1. Retrieve the service account json from firebase (Project overview > Project Settings > Service Accounts > Generate Private Key)
2. Rename the private key as `serviceAccountKey.json` and move it to /auth folder.
3. Add a list of values to be uploaded to the firebase collection in a file (eg: projects.js)
4. Run `npm install`
5. Run `node uploadScript`
