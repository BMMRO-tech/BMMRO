## Data export script

This script exports data from the Firebase Firestore to a csv file.

## Running the script

In the `scripts` directory:

1. Create `.env` file.
2. Add the following properties to `.env` file and set them to values that can be found in project settings inside firebaseConfig object in Firebase console:

- set `PROJECT_ID` to `projectId`
- set `API_KEY` to `apiKey`
- set `AUTH_DOMAIN` to `authDomain`
- set `EMAIL` and `PASSWORD` to your email address and password that you use to log in to the app

3. Install all dependencies:

```
npm install
```

4. Run the command below to start the script. You will need to specify a date range to export the data entries from. First argument passed to the command is a start date (entries from this date will be included) and second argument is an end date (entries from this date will be excluded). Dates need to be in `dd/mm/yyyy` format, for example:

```
npm start -- "01/06/2020" "01/07/2020"
```

The csv file will be saved in `exported` folder.
